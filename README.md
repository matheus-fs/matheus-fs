- 👋 Hi, I’m @matheus-fs
- I work as a Data Analyst at MVW Technology, a modern workplace consultancy company based on England. 
- I have a Civil Engineer degree but migrated to a data related carreer. My code journey started by applying scripts in python and VBA to automate some routines at my job.
- Since then I've been discovering more about software engineering, computer and data science. I'm fascinated with it, it's amazing how much you can do with few lines of code.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to software developent and data science!!   
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-sonego/
